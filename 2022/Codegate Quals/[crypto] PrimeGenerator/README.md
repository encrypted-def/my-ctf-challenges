# [crypto] Prime Generator

## Tag

RSA, Coppersmith attack, Chinese remainder theorem

## Difficulty

Medium

## Scenario

296 bits `UPPER` is fixed first. Then the user receives sufficiently many primes with a form `UPPER|lower` for a random `lower`.

A user also receives a encrypted flag with RSA. Primes in RSA private key are also form `UPPER|lower`.
