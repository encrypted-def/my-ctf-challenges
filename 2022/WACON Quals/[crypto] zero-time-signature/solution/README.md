# [crypto] Zero time signature

## Solution

Users must send a value greater than the respective value for each byte of SPELL to determine the correct `signature[0..17]` for SPELL. However, in doing so, it seems impossible to know the correct value for the `signature[18]`, which is generated by adding up the entire ASCII code values.

As long as the user inputs only printable ASCII, it is impossible to forge the signature. However, Python's `ord` function can return values greater than 255, and since negative indices can be used in arrays, you can cleverly use `ord(256)`, `ord(512)`, and similar values to forge the signature.
