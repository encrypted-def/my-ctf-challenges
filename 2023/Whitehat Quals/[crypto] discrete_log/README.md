## Scenario

In the problem, a 1020-bit random value $x$ is generated by appending a random byte after flag each time, and the attacker knows a randomly chosen base $g$ and $g^x \mod p$ for any $p$ he chooses, 77 times in total. However, $p$ must satisfy a number of conditions defined in the `is_safe_prime` function. These conditions are

1. $p$ must be 1024 bits or less.
2. $p-1$ must have a prime factor $q$ of at least 1000 bits.
